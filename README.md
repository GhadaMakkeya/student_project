# 🎓 Student Task Management System (OOP Project)


<br><br>
📌 **Overview**
This project is a console-based C# application for managing students’ academic tasks, supporting both university students and school students.
It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling.

The system allows:

- Adding assignments or projects
- Removing assignments or projects
- Viewing tasks
- Saving student information and tasks into separate files for each student type
